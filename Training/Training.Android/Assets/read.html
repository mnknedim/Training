A Child’s Imagination
It’s a beautiful sunny day. Christy Miller is lying in the ham¬mock in the back yard. She can hear the woodpeckers in the trees. Peck.. .peck.. .peck. She can smell the beautiful flowers near the stream. She can hear the roar of the crocodiles com¬ing from the stream. What! Crocodiles! Christy looks. Four big crocodiles are walking toward the hammock!
“What can I do?” Christy says. She sees the big chestnut tree near her house. She runs to it, and climbs to the first branch. She hears another roar. There is a leopard in the tree with her! The crocodiles are under the tree. There is no place to go!
Christy climbs higher and higher. Soon, she is at the top of the tree. Where can she go now? She looks down, and sees a gorilla sitting near her. It looks very hungry. Christy can’t fly. Where can she go?
Suddenly, a purple airplane comes out from behind the clouds. It stops near the top of the tree. Christy gets in the plane. Christy sits down in a pink seat. It has yellow stripes. She is the only passenger on the plane. There is only a little window. Christy looks out. The plane is going very fast. She can see white clouds. That’s all.
The door to the cockpit opens. A very strange alien is walks out. It looks like “E.T.” Its body is very little, but its head is very big. It has big red eyes. It has green, pointed ears. It makes strange noises. It is wearing an orange hat and green Converse sneakers.
Christy smiles at the strange man. “Can you speak English?”
“Of course, I can. I can speak 45,000 languages from 1,200 different planets.”
